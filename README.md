# OpenWIS - Pilots tutorials

This repository hosts a series of mini-tutorials to bring you up to speed to the core concepts and technologies envisaged to be used in future versions of OpenWIS. Each tutorial is composed of a set of slide-like information cards as well as, possibly, source code to demonstrate the concepts. As most tutorials build on the knowledge presented in a previous tutorial, we suggest you start tackling them sequentially.
